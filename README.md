On the main screen we have 4 edit texts for the user to input the song name, artist name, what they would rate the song from 1 to 5 and a comment for the song. The add to list button adds all the user inputs into a parallel array, it supposed to clear the edit texts for the user to enter more inputs but mine closes the emulator. The go to detailed view screen button navigates the user to the second activity which is the display screen. The exit button terminated the app completely.

On the display screen we have a button at the top that when clicked it will display all the user inputs in the textview provided below. The second button will calculate the average of the ratings of all the songs. Once the average is created, it will be displayed in the second textview below the calculate average button. The final button on the display screen is a main screen button that will navigate the user back to the main screen.
