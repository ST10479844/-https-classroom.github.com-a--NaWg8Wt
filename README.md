On the main screen we have 4 edit texts for the user to input the song name, artist name, what they would rate the song from 1 to 5 and a comment for the song. The add to list button adds all the user inputs into a parallel array, it supposed to clear the edit texts for the user to enter more inputs but mine closes the emulator.
